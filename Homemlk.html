<strong><p> Martin Luther King Jr. Was born on January 15, 1929 and he died on April 4, 1968.

He is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience. He delivered the I have a dream speech, which is still remembered today. He was inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. He was the son of early civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Sr.</p> </strong>
<strong> <p> He also participated in and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights. He led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).
