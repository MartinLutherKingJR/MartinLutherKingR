<h4>Pre March </h4>
</center>

<p>King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the "Big Six" civil rights organizations who were extremely important to the organization of the March On Washington For Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy WIlkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis, SNCC; and James L. Farmer Jr., of the Congress of Racial Equality. </p>
<p> Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause. </p>
<p> The march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment, protection of civil rights workers from police brutality, a $2 minimum wage for all workers (equivalent to $17 in 2019); and self-government for Washington, D.C. then governed by congressional committee. Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success. More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended the event, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history. </p>

 <h4> The Speech </h4>
 </center>
 <p> King delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as "I Have a Dream" To read the entire speech, <a href="https://www2.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/siteassets/Schools/Middle-Schools/A-F/leems/uploadedFiles/news/Full-text-I-Have-a-Dream-.pdf">Click Here!</a> </p>
 
 <p>  "I Have a Dream" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory. The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers in the United States and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The original typewritten copy of the speech, including King's handwritten notes on it, was discovered in 1984 to be in the hands of George Raveling, the first African-American basketball coach of the University Of Iowa. In 1963, Raveling, then 26 years old, was standing near the podium, and immediately after the oration, impulsively asked King if he could have his copy of the speech, and he got it. </p>
