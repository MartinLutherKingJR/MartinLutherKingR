<h4>Birth</h4>
</center>
<p> King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to the Reverend Michael King Sr. and Alberta King King's mother named him Michael, which was entered onto the birth certificate by the attending physician. King's older sister is Christine King Farris and his younger brother was Alfred Daniel "A.D." King. In his adolescent years, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta where he attained a high school education. King Sr. then enrolled in Morehouse College and studied to enter the ministry. King Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926.They lived together on the second floor of her parent's two-story Victorian house where King was born. Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Adam Daniel Williams died of a stroke in the spring of 1931. That fall, King's father took over the role of pastor at the church, where he would in time raise the attendance from six hundred to several thousand. In 1934, he began referring to himself as Martin Luther King Sr., and his son as Martin Luther King Jr. King's birth certificate was altered to read "Martin Luther King Jr." on July 23, 1957, when he was 28 years old. </p>

<h4>Childhood</h4>
</center>
<p> At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father. After dinners, King's grandmother Jennie, who he affectionately referred to as "Mama", would tell lively stories from the Bible to her grandchildren. King's father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children. At times, King Sr. would also have his children whip each other. King's father later remarked, "Martin was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He'd stand there, and the tears would run down, and he'd never cry."  Once when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it. When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit into their grandmother, Jennie, causing her to fall down unresponsive. King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window. Upon hearing that his grandmother was alive, King rose and left the ground where he had fallen. </p>

<p> King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his family's home. In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school. King had to attend a school for black children, Younge Street Elementary School, while his close playmate went to a separate school for white children only. Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him "we are white, and you are colored". When King relayed the happenings to his parents, they had a long discussion with him about the history of slavery and racisim in America Upon learning of the hatred, violence and oppression that black people had faced in the U.S., King would later state that he was "determined to hate every white person". His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone. </p>

<p> King witnessed his father stand up against segregation and various forms of discrimination. Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as "boy", King's father responded sharply that King was a boy but he was a man. When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back. King's father refused, stating "we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all", before taking King and leaving the store. He told King afterwards, "I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it." In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African-Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination. </p>

<p>King memorized and sang hymns, and memorized several verses from the Bible, by the time he was five years old. Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing songs while she played piano. His favorite hymn to sing was "I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus." King later became a member of the junior choir in his church. King enjoyed opera, and played the piano. As he grew up, King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries. He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words in fights. King did not show any  interest in grammar and spelling, and this continued throughout his whole life. In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in slave costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone With The Wind In September 1940.  When he was 12,  King was enrolled at the Atlanta
  University Laboratory School. While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and he also showed a great interest in his history and English classes. </p>

<h4>Adolescence</h4>
</center>

<p>In 1942, at 13 years old, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal. He skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in high school where he maintained a B-plus average. The high school was the only one in the city for African American students. In high school, King became known for his public-speaking ability, with an extremely strong voice.  He proceeded to join the school's debate team He continued to be most drawn to history and ELA. He chose English and sociology to be his main subjects while at the school.  He continued to have a strong vocabulary, but he relied on his sister to help him with his spelling, while King assisted her with math. </p>

<p> On April 13, 1944, in his junior year, MLK gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest. In his speech he stated, "black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man. Even winners of our highest honors face the class color bar."  King was chosen as the winner of the contest. On the ride home to Atlanta on a bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. He initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not follow the directions of the driver. As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand on the rest of the drive back to Atlanta. It was amazing that after he gave that speech, he was immediately affected by racism.  </p>
